\section{Research Interests}

My primary research focus is numerical methods for partial differential equations.
Specifically, I am working on a finite element method using nonstandard meshes incorporating cells with curved edges and holes, using ideas from virtual element methods and boundary element methods.
I also have experience in numerical optimization and high performance computing.
